*** README ***

This is a small program aimed at effortless commandline currency conversion.

It is powered by the data provided publicly by the Czech National Bank,
therefore I am not able to guarantee accuracy and/or availability of
the service. However, I aim to update the program should the conditions 
of the Czech National Bank change.

This program requires a working internet connection and Python installed.

Have fun, Tomas Radej

*** ROADPLAN ***

    * Handling of malformed input files

*** KNOWN ISSUES ***

    * You need to specify the amount of currency to convert. In future
      versions, I want the program to assume the amount to 1 if no amount
      is specified.
    * Under Windows, the temp file is stored in Drive:/tmp/cconv instead
      of the proper Drive:/Temp/cconv 
    * Acts weird under Python 2.6
    * Help file is not that helpful
    * Some of the sheets provided by the bank have errors in them, currently
      the program crashes on such occurence.
