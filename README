*** README ***

This is a small program aimed at effortless commandline currency conversion.

It is powered by the data provided publicly by the Czech National Bank,
therefore I am not able to guarantee accuracy and/or availability of
the service. However, I aim to update the program should the conditions 
of the Czech National Bank change.

This program requires a working internet connection and Python installed.

Have fun, Tomas Radej
